# while_loop
This project is a simple JavaScript exercise designed to practice using `while` loops along with other fundamental JavaScript concepts, such as variables, data types, operators, arrays, and DOM manipulation.


# JS While Loop Practice

## Features

 **DOM Interaction**: A button triggers the generation of an array.
 **`while` Loop**: Iterates to populate an array with squared numbers.
**Array Manipulation**: Dynamically adds data to an array during the loop.
 **Output Display**: Updates the DOM to show the result.



## Files Included

**index.html**: The main HTML file with the structure of the project.
**style.css**: Contains styling for the page.
**script.js**: Includes the JavaScript code for the functionality.


## How It Works
1. Click the "Generate Array with While Loop" button.
2. The JavaScript code runs a `while` loop, populating an array with the squares of numbers from 0 to 9.
3. The resulting array is displayed dynamically in the output section of the webpage.


## Example Output

Generated Array: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
